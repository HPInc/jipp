# JIPP: A Java-compatible IPP library

This project contains:

* `jipp-core`, the core IPP parser/builder for [IPP packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol).
* `jipp-pdls`, which converts raster format docs to common page description languages (PCLm and PWG-Raster).
* `jprint`, a sample app showing how jipp-core can be used to send a document to a printer.

`jipp-core` features:
* Supports construction of IPP servers, clients, routers, gateways, etc.
* Common operations and attributes are defined and ready to use.
* Can be extended to support new operations and attributes.
* Can be used over any transport (typically HTTP).
* Includes a pretty-printer for human-readable IPP packet display.
* Kotlin users can access a type-safe packet building [DSL](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html)

What could I do with this?
* Scan and show available printers on your network to your users.
* Implement an Android Print Service.
* Test IPP clients or IPP printers in interesting ways.
* Experiment with alternative IPP transports.
* Implement a cloud-based print server or client.

The API is fully Java-compatible but is actually implemented in Kotlin.
[JavaDoc](https://hpinc.github.io/jipp/javadoc/index.html) is available for the Java-facing API.

## Usage

In short:

1. Add the current version of JIPP to your project
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.hp.jipp:jipp-core:0.5.7'
    compile 'com.hp.jipp:jipp-pdl:0.5.7' // Only needed if transforming PDLs
}
```
2. Create an `IppClientTransport` or `IppServerTransport` (see example
[`HttpIppClientTransport.java`](https://github.com/HPInc/jipp/blob/master/sample/jprint/src/main/java/sample/HttpIppClientTransport.java))
3. Use the transport to send and receive `IppPacket` objects, e.g.:
```
URI uri = URI.create("http://192.168.1.100:631/ipp/print");
IppPacket printRequest = new IppPacket(Operation.printJob, 123,
        groupOf(operationAttributes,
                attributesCharset.of("utf-8"),
                attributesNaturalLanguage.of("en"),
                printerUri.of(uri),
                requestingUserName.of("user"),
                documentFormat.of("application/octet-stream")));
transport.sendData(uri, new IppPacketData(printRequest, new FileInputStream(inputFile)));
```

A very basic use case is demonstrated by the `jprint` sample app. To run it:

```
# build the app
./gradlew jprint:build

# unzip in the current directory
unzip -o ./sample/jprint/build/distributions/jprint-*.zip

# Use IPP to print a file to the supplied HTTP/IPP endpoint.
# (The printer must natively support the file type.)
jprint-*/bin/jprint "ipp://192.168.1.102:631/ipp/print" sample.pdf
```

## API Maturity

As an 0.5.x project, APIs may still be changed in non-backwards-compatible ways.

## Dependencies

`jipp-core`'s only dependencies are JDK 6+ and the current Kotlin runtime.

## Building

`./gradlew build`

A full build of this project requires `python` (2.x) and `dot` to generate dependency graphs
